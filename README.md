It involved creating a dictionary database by loading words from text files in various languages and sizes. The project featured three main applications: loading the dictionary into the BST and displaying tree structures, implementing efficient search functionality with timing analysis to evaluate performance as the dictionary size increased, and developing a spell checker that identified misspelled words in a text file while also indicating the language of correctly spelled words. Through this project, participants gained hands-on experience with tree-based data management, algorithmic performance evaluation, and recursive methods in a structured data environment.
